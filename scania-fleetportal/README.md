# Scania Test Case

The main Angular project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

Once the application is installed and running, navigate to [the fleet portal landing page](http://localhost:4200/home).

## To Install the Application

1. Run `npm install` here in `scania-fleetportal` root. (`./scania-test-case/scania-fleetportal/`)
2. Run `npm install` and then `npm run build ` in `./scania-test-case/web-components/scania-fleetportal-dropdown`.

   - The dropdown web component is automatically linked to the main Angular application. See the `src/libs` directory for how that's done.

3. Run `npm start` in `scania-fleetportal` root.
