# Scania Test Case

Mockup of a Scania Fleet Portal web application

Due to the particular nature of getting StencilJs to work with Angular 14, the Angular 14 application is found under `scania-fleetportal` and the dropdown web component under `web-components`.

The main Angular project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

Once the application is installed and running, navigate to [the fleet portal landing page](http://localhost:4200/home).

## Installation and Configuration

1. Run `npm install` here in `scania-fleetportal` root. (`./scania-test-case/scania-fleetportal/`)
2. Run `npm install` and then `npm run build ` in `./scania-test-case/web-components/scania-fleetportal-dropdown`.

   - The dropdown web component is automatically linked to the main Angular application. See the `src/libs` directory for how that's done.

## Show Me the App!

Run `npm start` in `scania-fleetportal` root.
